The code uses the library dplyr to use basic data frame functions.
The code imports the relevant data from the Samsung data in the user's working directory.
The training data is combined with the test data, resulting in over 10,000 observations on one dataset.
The code then extracts only the measurements on the mean and the standard deviation for each measurement.
The activities are then given descriptive names and the data is appropriately labelled with descriptive variable names
Finally, a second tidy data set is outputted with the average of each variable for each actviity and each subject.
